When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    * I guess it would be useful to use a remote repository if you are working on a different 
      computer than where you have your code, and want to access your work from elsewhere 
      (provided that the remote code is updated)
    * You might also want to use the remote as a backup of your project. 
    * If there is more than one contributor to the project - and you do not share the same network 
      storage - a remote repository will be a necessity. I.e. open source development (but actually 
      any kind of development where the developers work from different locations)
      
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It seems like manual is the key to the Git philosophy. I guess that is because it gives you
    better control of the project, and also better quality of the commits. 
    
    As for pulling changes automatically, this might lead to bringing into the local (original) 
    repository changes that you really don't want. Let's say you are working remotely and your code 
    is comitted but isn't tested yet. An automatic pull will break the code of the branch if it 
    happens at the wrong time.
