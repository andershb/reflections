When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    * I guess it would be useful to use a remote repository if you are working on a different computer than where you have your code, 
      and want to access your work from elsewhere (provided that the remote code is updated)
    * You might also want to use the remote as a backup of your project. 
    * If there is more than one contributor to the project - and you do not share the same network storage - a remote repository 
      will be a necessity. I.e. open source development (but actually any kind of development where the developers work 
      from different locations)
